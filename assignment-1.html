        <p>My main goal in this course is to learn and become comfortable with
          HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and learn tenants of good web design. I
          hope that these skills will help me in my personal design and computer science career.
        </p>
        <p>I grew up in Longmont, Colorado, and currently I'm a freshman at the University of Colorado,
          Boulder. I'm a creative technology & design and computer science double major.
          I love tabletop and video games, cooking, and doing creative work; and I hope to make a
          career where I can use my creativity to make the things I want.
